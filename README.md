In this project, I developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits, ranging from 0 to 9. This involved training the model using a dataset of digit images, allowing it to accurately identify and differentiate between the various numbers. (accuracy achieved= 97.98%)
